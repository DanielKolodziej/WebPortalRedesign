# Add/Drop Class Redesign

## The Problem

It is a very complicated task to get to the stage where you can start picking classes. We would like to simplify the process for students by these following steps. 

1. Login
2. Opening Acedemics tab
2. Entering Pin
3. Select Add/Drop class
4. Choose either Major classes, Humanities classes or other.


## Login

Login page simplified similar to iOS style: 
1. Simple login form with username and password
2. Logo and banner as header design

## Welcome


There will be nav bar with simplified options. 
1. Academics
2. Finances
3. Blackboard
4. Email
5. Research



## Academics

When you click at Academics, there will be further options.
1. Add or Drop
2. Look-up/Register

Only two options instead of so many unnecessary task panes. This is more clear and visible for the user. Students usually get lost in the current website.

## Add or Drop
After clicking Add or Drop:

1. Enter desired semester
2. Enter pin number

This will be only in one page, to keep it simple. 

## Registering for classes. 

1. Add 
2. Drop

## Add
Show 3 options: 

1. Major classes
2. Humanities classes
3. Other classes

## Drop
This will show the current schedule

1. There will be an red "X" sign next to the current class, to drop it.
