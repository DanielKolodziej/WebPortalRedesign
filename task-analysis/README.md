# Add/Drop Class Redesign

## The Problem
There is a lot of information that student doesn't really need, and as students, we don't pay much attention to news in different departments. Therefore, we will only leave the necessary information that is directly relevant to the student (such as news from the department that student is part of). It is a very complicated task to get to the stage where you can start picking classes. 
We would like to simplify the process of Add/Drop classes for students by these following steps. 

1. Login
2. Opening Acedemics tab
2. Entering Pin & desired semester
3. Select Add or Drop class
4. If Add is chosen - Choose either Major classes, Humanities classes or other.
5. If Drop is chosen - Show current schedule, with red "x" to drop classes. 

## Login

Login page simplified similar to iOS style: 

1. Simple login form with username and password
2. Logo and banner as header design

## Welcome
![alt text](https://github.com/DanielKolodziej/WebPortalRedesign/blob/master/task-analysis/welcome.JPG "Logo Title Text 1")
There will be nav bar with simplified options directly relevant to that student. 

1. Welcome
2. Academics
3. Finances
4. Other Resources

## Academics

When you click at Academics, there will be further options.

1. Registration Tools
2. Self-Banner Service
3. Other resources

Only two options instead of so many unnecessary task panes that majority of students don't look at. This is more clear and visible for the user. Students usually get lost in the current website. Furthermore, we will change the "excel list" style to more user-friendly interface. 

## Add or Drop
![alt text](https://github.com/DanielKolodziej/WebPortalRedesign/blob/master/task-analysis/courses.JPG "Logo Title Text 1")
Under Registration Tools, our group will focus on Add/Drop option. Instead of clicking through so many webpages, we will combine it into 1 webpage. This will be in a "sign up" format to get student's data.
After clicking Add or Drop, we will request the student to enter:

1. Desired semester
2. Pin number

This will be only in one page, to keep it simple. 

## Registering for classes. 
![alt text](https://github.com/DanielKolodziej/WebPortalRedesign/blob/master/task-analysis/itm.JPG "Logo Title Text 1")
Once you enter, there will be only 2 options to keep it simple and clear. 

1. Add 
2. Drop

## Add
Under Add, there will be 3 options. Instead of looking through the long list of ALL the courses offered in IIT, we will simplify to these 3 categories: Major, Humanities and Other classes.

1. Major classes
2. Humanities classes
3. Other classes

Once you find your course, it will appear in a school table (like in Week at Glance, which will be shown under "Drop" section). This will show the exact date and time in the timetable slot, which is very clear for the student. Once you hover onto the class, it will show a bubble (like a message bubble) for further information like location, Professor name and section number.

## Drop
![alt text](https://github.com/DanielKolodziej/WebPortalRedesign/blob/master/task-analysis/add-drop.JPG "Logo Title Text 1")
This will show the current schedule of the student in a "week at a glance". In the corner of the course, there will be a red "x" to drop the class.
This will keep the design simple and easy to adapt for new students as well. Unlike the current drop class webpage, which shows "excel table style" information and too many steps to drop a class. 

1. It will show current schedule.
2. There will be an red "X" sign next to the current class, to drop it. 

(Our group couldn't provide screenshots of current my.iit webpages of Add/Drop because we need a PIN number to access those pages. It's currently the registration period for Summer & Fall classes. Due to this inconvenience, we will provide those screenshots in the near future. )
