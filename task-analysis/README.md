# Drop/Withdraw Class Redesign

## Goal
There is a lot of information that student doesn't really need, and as students, we don't pay much attention to news in different departments. Therefore, we will only leave the necessary information that is directly relevant to the student (such as news from the department that student is part of). It is a very complicated task to get to the stage where you can start picking classes. 
We would like to simplify the process of Add/Drop classes for students by these following steps. 

1. Login
2. Navigating to Acedemics tab
3. Scroll down to Drop/Withdraw section of the page
4. select with courses to drop from your current schedule

#####Here is a [link](https://my.iit.edu) to the original WebPortal we are redesigning.

## Login

Login page simplified similar to iOS style: 

1. Simple login form with username and password
2. Logo and banner as header design

## Welcome
![alt text](https://github.com/DanielKolodziej/WebPortalRedesign/blob/master/task-analysis/welcome.JPG "welcome")
There will be nav bar with simplified options directly relevant to that student. 

1. Welcome
2. Academics
3. Finances
4. Student Life
5. Resources
6. Log Out

## Academics

When you click on Academics, there will be further task pane options.

1. Student OVerview
2. Registration/add
3. Withdraw/Drop
4. Transcript
5. Student Grades

Keeping it simple instead of so many unnecessary task panes that majority of students don't look at. This is more clear and visible for the user. Students usually get lost in the current website. Furthermore, we will change the "excel list" style to more user-friendly modern interface. 

## Entering semester and pin number

![alt text](https://github.com/DanielKolodziej/WebPortalRedesign/blob/master/task-analysis/pin.JPG "select pin")

This will be in a "sign in" format to get student's data.
After clicking Add or Drop, we will request the student to enter:

1. Desired semester
2. Pin number

## Drop
![alt text](https://github.com/DanielKolodziej/WebPortalRedesign/blob/master/task-analysis/add-drop.JPG "week's schedule")

1. It will show current schedule.
2. There will be a "Withdraw" button next to the current class.

NOTE: Our group decided to motify the task a little bit to only focus on dropping the courses. Without the backend coding and the data-storing methods, it is really challenging to actually have classes with time stamps working in a schedule. Instead, in our website, we decided to include a dummy adding/registering function that will give you a sign saying how student has holds and thus cannot register.
